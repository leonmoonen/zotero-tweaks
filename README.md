# zotero-tweaks

Placeholder for teaking Zotero, such as added Lookup Engines.

## Lookup Engines

Zotero's [Lookup Engines](https://www.zotero.org/support/locate) allow you 
to start online searches related to items in your library.
They are currently configured via a json file that needs to be installed in 
your [Zotero data directory](https://www.zotero.org/support/zotero_data).

The folder `lookup_engines` contains my configuration of lookup engines, and
a Makefile to install it (after making a backup of the previous version).
